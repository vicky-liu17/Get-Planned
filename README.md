## Getting Started

### Prerequisites: API Key Setup

This project requires a Large Language Model (LLM) API key to function. Before running the application, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your API key to the file using the following format:
   ```env
   LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

```

*(Note: Ensure you do not commit your `.env.local` file to version control.)*

### Run the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
